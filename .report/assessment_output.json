While CodeMeta provides you with a more comprehensive description, CFF is a more lightweight, good-enough approach to software (with built-in support by GitHub) citation. Both provide tools (<a href=\"https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/\" target=\"_blank\">CodeMeta generator</a>, <a href=\"https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/#/\" target=\"_blank\">CFFINIT</a>)to easily generate a working citation file.
